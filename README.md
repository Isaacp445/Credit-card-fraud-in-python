In this project I conducted an EDA on a credit card fraud dataset
When I chose this type of project at the time I attended the camp flog gnaw music festival in los angeles and in the time spent there I noticed that credit card wasn't active I called my bank and come to find out they froze
my account because of some purchases I made and thinking that fraud had been commited. Even though there wasn't any fraud commited I thought to myself how common is it for others to have credit card fraud happen.
